== Introduction ==

This section of the project contains information on using the [http://www.kernel.org/ Linux kernel] port for the OpenRISC 1000 family.

Information about Linux on OpenRISC as well as updated toolchains can be found at http://openrisc.net

Features are: 
 •Free, open source code with no royalty
 •UNIX class operating system
 •Upstream
 •gdbserver for OpenRISC 
 •Process protection through use of the Memory Management Unit
 •Multitasking, preemptive scheduling
 •Interprocess communication and synchronization
 •TCP/IP networking and numerous other network protocols
 •File systems NFS, ext2, MS-DOS, FAT16/32 and others
 •PS2 Keyboard

== Status ==
 
OpenRISC is officially supported in the Linux kernel since version 3.1 and can be downloaded from https://www.kernel.org. We do however recommend that you use one of the kernels from http://git.openrisc.net/ as they contain some convenient features such as a built-in initramfs and extra board configurations for OpenRISC not found in the upstream kernel. 

A gdbserver is now available in SVN for use when debugging applications under Or1ksim Linux. gdbserver acts as a GDB remote serial protocol server for a Linux application, allowing the program to be debugged remotely using GDB.

===Supported Boards===
 
Only DE0 Nano and a configuration for or1ksim are officially supported in the kernel sources. See below for how to add support for additional boards. Device trees and configuration files cod other boards can be found in the [https://github.com/openrisc/orpsoc-cores orpsoc-cores] collection (e.g. https://github.com/openrisc/orpsoc-cores/blob/master/systems/neek/data/sw/neek.dts)

== Initial preparations ==
 
At present the Linux port is maintained by Jonas Bonn of South Pole and kept in their git repositories http://git.openrisc.net/cgit.cgi/jonas/linux/.


To obtain a copy of the kernel tree source with OpenRISC support, ensure git is installed and run
 
  git clone git://git.openrisc.net/jonas/linux

'''NOTE:''' At the time of writing, the best supported version is the `smp` branch of http://git.openrisc.net/cgit.cgi/stefan/linux/ Use the following commands to clone and switch to the smp branch
 git clone git://git.openrisc.net/stefan/linux
 git checkout smp

The environment variables `ARCH` and `CROSS_COMPILE` must be set prior to running any `make` command. The `CROSS_COMPILE` command can be set to any toolchain capable of building an OpenRISC Linux kernel (e.g. or1k-linux-musl-)
 export ARCH=openrisc
 export CROSS_COMPILE=or1k-elf-

Setup a generic default configuration for OpenRISC targets. This will likely generate a bunch of questions for options that are not set in the default configuration file. Choose values that seem appropriate for these options.
 make defconfig

Optionally select other options you want to enable or disable
 make menuconfig

== Build ==

 make

After `make` is complete, there will be a file called `vmlinux` in the kernel root directory. This is the built Linux Kernel in the form of an `ELF` file that can be run in or1ksim, or uploaded to a running OpenRISC Instance with OpenOCD or GDB, or be converted to a `bin` file that can be programmed to a Flash memory

== Run on or1ksim ==

The following commands will run a kernel on the OpenRISC architectural simulator. This is a good way to test if your kernel will boot up before you try it on hardware

 or1k-elf-sim -f arch/openrisc/or1ksim.cfg vmlinux

== Run on FPGA target ==

The following commands, will build a kernel, and then run it on FPGA board. An example of demonstration using Virtex5 ML501 is illustrate in the following photo

These guides go into detail regarding debugging specific targets. [[Debugging physical targets (FPGA/ASIC)]] 
  or_debog_proxy$ ./or_debug_proxy -r 55555
  
  linux-3.0$ Minicom (115200 8N1)
  
  linux-3.0$ or32-linux-gdb vmlinux

[[File:linux_30_work.png|400px|linux-3.0 ML501 Photo]]

Remember that this is using GDB to debug the kernel itself. The GDB remote serial protocol server (or_debug_proxy) does not have visibility of the MMU, so you will be using physical addresses, which means symbolic names almost certainly will not work.

If you wish to debug applications running under Linux, you should use [[OpenRISC GNU tool chain#Building_gdbserver|gdbserver]] instead.
