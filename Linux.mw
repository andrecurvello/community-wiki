== Introduction ==

This section of the project contains information on using the [http://www.kernel.org/ Linux kernel] port for the OpenRISC 1000 family.

Information about Linux on OpenRISC as well as updated toolchains can be found at http://openrisc.net

Features are: 
 •Free, open source code with no royalty
 •UNIX class operating system
 •Process protection through use of the Memory Management Unit
 •Multitasking, preemptive scheduling
 •Interprocess communication and synchronization
 •TCP/IP networking and numerous other network protocols
 •File systems NFS, ext2, MS-DOS, FAT16/32 and others

== Status ==
 
Kernel version is tracking mainline. It is capable of booting and running BusyBox userspace. The C library providing user space support is uClibc.
 
== Download source ==
 
At present the Linux port is maintained by Jonas Bonn of South Pole and kept in their git repositories.
 
To obtain a copy of the kernel tree source with OpenRISC support, ensure git is installed and run
 
git clone git://git.openrisc.net/jonas/linux 

== Build and run on or1ksim ==
[[File:linux30_menuconf_doc.jpg|thumb|linux-3.0 menuconf Photo]] 
The following commands, will build a kernel, and then run it on the OpenRISC architectural simulator. Note that there is a build of BusyBox pre-configured in the initial ramdisk filesystem.
 
Note that you will need the latest OpenRISC GNU toolchain port and or1ksim installed.
 
 •linux-3.0$ make defconfig
 •linux-3.0$ make menuconfig
 •linux-3.0$ make
 •linux-3.0$ or32-elf-sim -f arch/openrisc/or1ksim.cfg vmlinux
