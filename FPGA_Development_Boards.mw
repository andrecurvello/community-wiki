This section contains a list of boards, and certain details, that there are push-button synthesis builds for in ORPSoC.

Once you have your board up and running, you may find the guide to [[Debugging physical targets (FPGA/ASIC)|debugging physical targets]]  useful.

=== Pre-built image for SPI flash ===
[ftp://ocuser:ocuser@openrisc.opencores.org/orpsoc/images/orpsoc-ml501-66MHz.mcs orpsoc-ml501-66MHz.mcs]
See the ML501 documentation in ORPSoC for instructions on programming this image into the board's SPI flash.
=== Flash boot image with U-boot programmer ===
Image for SPI flash: [ftp://ocuser:ocuser@openrisc.opencores.org/orpsoc/images/orpsoc-ml501-66MHz-flashboot.mcs orpsoc-ml501-66MHz-flashboot.mcs]

Software to embed U-boot into flash reset vector: [ftp://ocuser:ocuser@openrisc.opencores.org/orpsoc/images/ml501-flash-uboot-programmer.elf ml501-flash-uboot-programmer.elf ]

Load the SPI flash as per the instructions, and execute the software to program U-boot into the board's flash. The board will then power up with the U-boot prompt.

== Digilent Atlys ==
* Board path: xilinx/atlys
* CPU core frequency: 50MHz
* Supported devices
** AC97
** Ethernet
** GPIO
** PS/2
** DDR2 SDRAM (128MB)
** SPI
** UART
** VGA
