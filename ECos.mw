== Introduction ==

This page contains information on eCos port for the OpenRISC 1000 family.

== Status ==

This is an initial release. 
Currently, only ROM startup option is supported and tested. 
Other startup options are being tested and will be available soon.
The port has been tested using or1ksim-0.5.1rc1.

Example or1ksim and eCos configuration files are provided with this port.

== Download ==

 svn co http://opencores.org/ocsvn/openrisc/openrisc/trunk/rtos/ecos-3.0

== Building and running ==

It is assumed, that or32-elf toolchain directory is already in the PATH variable.

=== Building eCos ===

First, set eCos envirnomental variable. 
This is required to build eCos.
It is not necessary for application development, later on.

 ECOS_REPOSITORY=/path-to-checkout-directory/ecos-3.0/packages
 export ECOS_REPOSITORY

Create a directory for eCos build

 mkdir ecos_openrisc

Now use example configuration

 cp ecos-3.0/packages/hal/openrisc/arch/v3_0/doc/ecos.ecc ecos_openrisc/

Everything is ready to build eCos

 cd ecos_openrisc/
 ecosconfig tree
 make
 cd ../

=== Building application ===

Create a directory for an application

 mkdir ecos_app
 cd ecos_app

Write your application.
You can use an example for now http://ecos.sourceware.org/docs-1.3.1/tutorials/sh3/ecos-tutorial.13.html

Finally, build the application

 or32-elf-gcc \
    -g \
    -I../ecos_openrisc/install/include \
    -L../ecos_openrisc/install/lib \
    -nostdlib \
    -T../ecos_openrisc/install/lib/target.ld \
    -O2 \
    main.c

=== Running in simulator ===

First copy the provided simulator configuration

 cp ecos-3.0/packages/hal/openrisc/arch/v3_0/doc/or1ksim.cfg ./

Simulate your application

 or32-elf-sim -f or1ksim.cfg a.out
