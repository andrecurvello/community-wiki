* Direct mapped data cache
* Direct mapped instruction cache
* Data MMU based on hash-based DTLB
* Instruction MMU based on hash-based ITLB

== Status ==
RTL coding is finished and is being tested in different test applications. It has also been implemented in various commercial ASICs and FPGA.
If you would like to help with the development, please post to the OpenRISC forum or send an email to openrisc_team@opencores.org. 

== Implementation information ==
When implemented in a worst-case 0.18u 6LM process it should provide over 150 dhrystone 2.1 MIPS at 150MHz and 150 DSP MAC 32x32 operations.
The default OR1200 configuration is about 40k ASIC gates.
