These are the latest results from uClibc tool chain testing. Tests have been carried out using Or1ksim running Linux as a target. For performance reasons, the tests have been heavily parallelized (beyond the level in the standard GNU scripts), and the results combined.

Unless otherwise indicated, the tools (and libraries and Linux) are the SVN or git versions on the date shown, and record the number of tests in each [[test result category]]. For each tool an explanation is provided of any tests with a FAIL, XPASS or UNRESOLVED outcome.

==== FAIL tests ====

;ext/rope/pthread7-rope.cc execution test
;23_containers/list/pthread1.cc execution test
:Failure due to limitations of the underlying Linux thread support.

==== XPASS tests ====

;26_numerics/headers/cmath/c99_classification_macros_c++.cc
:This appears to be an out of date test, expecting a failure in compilation with uClibc that is no longer the case.

:This appears to be an out of date test, expecting failure in strtofp with uClibc, that is no longer the case.
