= Introduction = 

The OpenRISC 1000 port of the newlib library aims to provide a library to provide support for running on bare-metal hardware without an operating system. It is also used when running the GNU toolchain regression suite.

The library is automatically linked when using the newlib version of the GCC compiler (or32-elf-gcc). The target board is specified by -m''boardname''. If not board is specified, the default (-mor1ksim) is suitable for use with [[Or1ksim]].

= Port acknowledgements =

This [http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jab00/or32-newlib/ original port] was for newlib 1.13.0 by Jacob Bower, then of Imperial College, London.

The port was completely rewritten and tested for newlib 1.18.0 by [[User:Jeremybennett|Jeremy Bennett]] of [http://www.embecosm.com Embecosm].
Further information is availble in [http://www.embecosm.com/download/ean9.html Embecosm Application Note 9] ''Howto: Porting Newlib: A Simple Guide'', which explains in full detail how the port for the OpenRISC 1000 architecture was done.

The port was subsequently extended by [[User:Julius|Julius Baxter]] to make support of multiple boards much more flexible.

= OpenRISC support library =

To assist with using features of the OpenRISC processor such as exceptions, interrupts and timers, a support library has been implemented.

This library also provides support for particular boards in ORPSoC.
