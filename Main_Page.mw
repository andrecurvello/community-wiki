The aim of the OpenRISC project is to create free and open source computing platforms available under the GNU (L)GPL license. The platforms aim to provide:
* a free, open source RISC architecture with DSP features
* a set of free, open source implementations of the architecture
* a complete set of free, open source software development tools, libraries, operating systems and applications

This project is now fully maintained through a Wiki (the [http://opencores.org/or1k/OR1K:Community_Portal Community Portal]). The [http://opencores.org/openrisc,overview old web pages] are still available, but no longer maintained.
