The aim of the OpenRISC project is to create free and open source computing platforms available under the GNU (L)GPL license. The platforms aim to provide:
* a free, open source RISC architecture with DSP features
* a set of free, open source implementations of the architecture
* a complete set of free, open source software development tools, libraries, operating systems and applications

Some useful hot-links:
* Information about the [[OR1200 OpenRISC Processor]] and other [[OR1K:Community_Portal#Further_information|sources of information]]
* The [http://opencores.org/forum,OpenRISC OpenRISC forum] and [[OR1K:Community_Portal#Mailing_lists_on_openrisc.net|OpenRISC]] and [[OR1K:Community_Portal#Mailing_lists_on_opencores.org|OpenCores]] mailing lists.
* [[OR1K:Community_Portal#Get_source_code|Download]] source code
* OpenRISC [http://bugzilla.opencores.org/ bugzilla] and its [[OR1K:Community_Portal#Bug_reporting|documentation]]

This project is now fully maintained through a Wiki (the [[OR1K:Community_Portal|Community Portal]]). The [http://opencores.org/openrisc,overview old web pages] are still available, but no longer maintained.
