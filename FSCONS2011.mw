== Style ==

The following is an example flow of the workshop. It may be far more than we can do usefully in 4 hours.

We may want to split it up after intro + or1ksim.

* Monolithic
** Introduction
** OR1ksim
*** Examples
** Toolchain
*** Example
** ORPSoC
*** Example simulation
*** Example synthesis
*** Example use on board
** Software
*** Bare metal
**** Example compile and run on board
**** Example debugging on board
*** RTOSes
**** Example compile and run on board
*** u-boot
**** Example and run on board
*** Linux
**** Example and run on board
**** Example compile, download and ru userspace software
**** Example debugging userspace software

== Hardware ==

* Will we need it.
* If so, suggestion by Jeremy Bennett of asking 4 sponsors for a board or two each up to $70-$80 USD, limiting HW portion of workshop to  20 people around boards in groups of 3 or 4, and all boards to be raffled off at the end.
