This page contains information about the OpenRISC [http://my.fscons.org/schedule/session/47/ presentation] and [http://my.fscons.org/schedule/session/24/ workshop] that will be on at [http://fscons.org/ FSCONS 2011].

Details [http://my.fscons.org/schedule/session/47/ here]

= Workshop =

To register please go [http://my.fscons.org/schedule/session/24/  here].

We would like feedback from participants about which style they would most prefer the workshop to be - monolithic or consisting of two strands.

At this stage we are just discussing the options. We would appreciate feedback. Eventually some way for registered participants to indicate their preference will be organised, but for now we wouldn't mind if you could leave feedback on the [[Talk:FSCONS2011|wiki's discussion page]] or come to #opencores on irc.freenode.net and have a chat.
