This page contains information about the OpenRISC [http://my.fscons.org/schedule/session/47/ presentation] and [http://my.fscons.org/schedule/session/24/ workshop] that will be on at [http://fscons.org/ FSCONS 2011].

= Presentation =

Details [http://my.fscons.org/schedule/session/47/ here]

= Workshop =

To register please go [http://my.fscons.org/schedule/session/24/  here].

We would like feedback from participants about which style they would most prefer the workshop to be - monolithic or consisting of two strands.

At this stage we are just discussing the options. We would appreciate feedback. Eventually some way for registered participants to indicate their preference will be organised, but for now we wouldn't mind if you could leave feedback on the [[Talk:FSCONS2011|wiki's discussion page]] or come to #opencores on irc.freenode.net and have a chat.

== Style ==

The following is an example flow of the workshop. It may be far more than we can do usefully in 4 hours.

We may want to split it up after intro + or1ksim.

=== Monolithic ===

* Introduction
* OR1ksim
** Examples
* Toolchain
** Example
* ORPSoC
** Example simulation
** Example synthesis
** Example use on board
* Software
** Bare metal
*** Example compile and run on board
*** Example debugging on board
** RTOSes
*** Example compile and run on board
** u-boot
*** Example and run on board
** Linux
*** Example and run on board
*** Example compile, download and ru userspace software
*** Example debugging userspace software

=== Strands ===

Different strands of the workshop, oriented towards giving more in-depth demonstrations of each topic. Perhaps breaking into strands after a single introduction.

==== Software Strand ====

Examples to be done using or1ksim and/or pre-built hardware if available.

Potential topics with examples:
* Toolchain
* newlib & bare metal
* u-boot
* Linux kernel
* BusyBox and Linux userspace

==== Hardware Strand ====

Demonstrations to occur in RTL simulators and with pre-built hardware if available.

Potential topics with examples:
* OR1200 CPU
* ORPSoC - simulation
* ORPSoC - on-board use debugging

== Hardware ==

* Would be nice to have.
* Are participants willing to pay up to 200 EUR for a development kit along the lines of:
** [http://shop.trenz-electronic.de/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=961&SID Nexys 3]
** [http://shop.trenz-electronic.de/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=1_114_119&products_id=504 Spartan 3E Starter Kit]
** New ORSoC board
* Otherwise, we might ask 4 sponsors for a board or two each up to $70-$80 USD, limiting HW portion of workshop to  20 people around boards in groups of 3 or 4, and all boards to be raffled off at the end.
