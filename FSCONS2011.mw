This page is for ideas and suggestions for the OpenRISC presentation and workshop that will be on at FSCONS 2011.

= Workshop =

== Style ==

The following is an example flow of the workshop. It may be far more than we can do usefully in 4 hours.

We may want to split it up after intro + or1ksim.

=== Monolithic ===

** Introduction
** OR1ksim
*** Examples
** Toolchain
*** Example
** ORPSoC
*** Example simulation
*** Example synthesis
*** Example use on board
** Software
*** Bare metal
**** Example compile and run on board
**** Example debugging on board
*** RTOSes
**** Example compile and run on board
*** u-boot
**** Example and run on board
*** Linux
**** Example and run on board
**** Example compile, download and ru userspace software
**** Example debugging userspace software

=== Strands ===

Different strands of the workshop, oriented towards giving more in-depth demonstrations of each topic. Perhaps breaking into strands after a single introduction.

==== Software Strand ====

Examples to be done using or1ksim and/or pre-built hardware if available.

Potential topics with examples:
* Toolchain
* newlib & bare metal
* u-boot
* Linux kernel
* Linux userspace

==== Hardware Strand ====

Demonstrations to occur in RTL simulators and with pre-built hardware if available.

Potential topics with examples:
* OR1200 CPU
* ORPSoC - simulation
* ORPSoC - on-board use debugging

== Hardware ==

* Will we need it.
* If so, suggestion by Jeremy Bennett of asking 4 sponsors for a board or two each up to $70-$80 USD, limiting HW portion of workshop to  20 people around boards in groups of 3 or 4, and all boards to be raffled off at the end.
