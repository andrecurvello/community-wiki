This page contains information about the OpenRISC [http://my.fscons.org/schedule/session/47/ presentation] and [http://my.fscons.org/schedule/session/24/ workshop] that will be on at [http://fscons.org/ FSCONS 2011].

Details [http://my.fscons.org/schedule/session/47/ here]

= Workshop =

To register please go [http://my.fscons.org/schedule/session/24/  here].

The workshop will aim to take participants through the OpenRISC project and how to use its implementations during the 4 hour session.

Participants will:
* receive an introduction to the project and the OpenRISC 1000 architecture and its open source implementations
* compile programs, run and debug them in the architectural simulator, [[Or1ksim]]
* learn how the hardware implementations work, and how to simulate and extend them
* compile, load and execute bare-metal code on OpenRISC CPUs
* compile the Linux kernel for OpenRISC, download and boot it via U-boot
* compile, load, run and debug userspace code running on the Linux kernel on OpenRISC

At this stage we are not certain that there will be development boards available for everyone. The options are (1) participants pre-purchase boards to be collected and used at the event, or (2) we may engage sponsors to provide a few boards to be used in groups at the event, and are raffled off at the end.  We would like feedback on whether participants would prefer to pre-purchase an agreed board, or if they don't mind running all of the programs under simulation with the potential for sponsors to provide a few boards if we can arrange that. 

If you could leave feedback on the [[Talk:FSCONS2011|wiki's discussion page]] or come to #opencores on irc.freenode.net and have a chat, it would be appreciated.

== Programme ==

The following is likely to be the flow of the workshop. It may be far more than we can do usefully in 4 hours.

*Introduction to the architecture
* Toolchain
** Overview of GNU tools ports
** Overview of library ports
** Example
* OR1ksim
** Introduction
** Running programs
* Hardware
** OR1200
*** Introduce, explain
** ORPSoC
*** Example RTL simulation
*** Example synthesis
*** Example use on board
* Software
** Bare metal
*** Example compile and run on board
*** Example debugging on board
** RTOSes
*** Example compile and run on board
** u-boot
*** Example and run on board
** Linux
*** Example and run on board
*** Example compile, download and ru userspace software
*** Example debugging userspace software

== Hardware ==

* Would be nice to have.
* Are participants willing to pay up to 200 EUR for a development kit along the lines of:
** [http://shop.trenz-electronic.de/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=961&SID Nexys 3]
** [http://shop.trenz-electronic.de/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=1_114_119&products_id=504 Spartan 3E Starter Kit]
** New ORSoC board
* Otherwise, we might ask 4 sponsors for a board or two each up to $70-$80 USD, limiting HW portion of workshop to  20 people around boards in groups of 3 or 4, and all boards to be raffled off at the end.
