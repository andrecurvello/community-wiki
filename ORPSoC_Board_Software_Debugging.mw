== Overview ==
This page aims to provide practical information on debugging software running on an ORPSoC implementation on hardware.

== Introduction ==

There are a number of steps for getting a build of ORPSoC running software. There are typically
* Check and test physical connection of the debugger to the board
* Attach GDB to the debug proxy program
* Load and execute small programs to test the functionality of
** UART
** Memory
* Load and execute something more substantial and cool
** Benchmark program
** O/S kernel

Once the system is known to be working, the next step might be to load a bootloader into non-volatile memory to avoid having to connect the debugger to load software, but that is outside if the scope of this page. We will deal with the steps just outlined.
