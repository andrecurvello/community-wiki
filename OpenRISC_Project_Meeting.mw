== ORCONF 2013 ==

The second annual OpenRISC project conference - ORCONF 2013. 

Submissions for presentations, discussion topics and the like are now welcome - see the [[OpenRISC_Project_Meeting#Schedule|schedule section]] for details.

=== Registration ===

Registration is free and allows us to know who will be attending for scheduling and catering purposes.

'''Registration for the event is now open via Eventbrite:''' [http://orconf2013.eventbrite.co.uk/ Click here to register for ORCONF]

Please let us know any timing constraints on your attendance when registering. (<tt>set_multicycle_path -start 1hr -from {i:you} -to {i:orconf}</tt>)

=== Audience ===

This meeting will be accessible for anyone with a background in embedded systems at any level, whether acquainted with the project or not.

=== Date & Time ===

The event will run from 2pm on '''Saturday, October 5''' to early afternoon on '''Sunday, October 6'''. (This date has been amended since the first announcement.)

Lunch will be available from 12:30 on Saturday. The sessions will run until the evening, and be followed by dinner in a local pub. Sessions will resume Sunday morning and conclude after lunch in the early afternoon.

This arrangement should allow people to travel on Saturday morning and return home Sunday evening.

=== Venue ===

This year's conference will be held at the [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/ University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory] in '''Cambridge, England'''. A ''big'' thank you to David Greaves and the Computer Labs for hosting us.

==== Accommodation ====

Some recommendations for places to stay are:

* [http://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/577/Cambridge-Newmarket-Road-hotel Travelodge Newmarket Road] - they are quoting 50GBP for Friday night and 86GBP for Saturday night. It is close enough to town to walk, but is a 45-minute walk to the conference venue. Taxis between the train station and conference venue would be the best bet (if several are staying here they could be shared).
* [http://www.kayak.co.uk/#/hotels/Arundel-House-Hotel,Cambridge,CAM,United-Kingdom-c17146-h80251/2013-10-04/2013-10-06 Arundel House] - this is a well located hotel, and are quoting 77GBP per night when booked on Kayak.co.uk. The conference venue is a 25-minute walk from here.

==== Travel ====

Cambridge is well connected in the UK by train, and internationally via all of London's airports. However, '''London Stansted''' airport is the closest, and is only a 30-minute train ride from the center of Cambridge.

The Cambridge University Computer Laboratory website has a good section on[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/directions/ how to get there].

=== Cost ===

It is expected the conference will be free to attend, thanks to our wonderful [[#Sponsors|sponsors]].
