== ORCONF 2013 ==

The second annual OpenRISC project conference - ORCONF2013. 

The event is in the early stages of planning at present, so check back or subscribe to the [[OR1K:Community_Portal#Mailing_lists|project's mailing lists]] to be kept up to date.

Submissions for presentations, discussion topics and the like are now welcome - see the [[OpenRISC_Project_Meeting#Schedule|schedule section]] for details.

=== Audience ===

This meeting will be accessible for anyone with a background in embedded systems at any level, whether acquainted with the project or not.

=== Date & Time ===

The event will run over '''Saturday, October 5''' and '''Sunday, October 6'''. (This date has been amended since the first announcement.)

It is expected the event will run from early afternoon on Saturday, into the evening and sessions will resume Sunday morning and finish around early afternoon.

This arrangement should allow people to travel on Saturday morning and return home Sunday evening.

=== Venue ===

This year's conference will be held in '''Cambridge, England'''.

The precise venue is to be announced.

Cambridge is well connected in the UK by train, and internationally via all of London's airports. However, '''London Stansted''' airport is the closest, and is only a 30-minute train ride from the center of Cambridge.

=== Cost ===

It is expected the conference will be free to attend, thanks to our wonderful [[#Sponsors|sponsors]].

=== Schedule ===

There is no firm schedule as yet. It will consist of presentations, discussions and (possibly) workshops. See [[OpenRISC_Project_Meetings_Archive#Schedule|last year's schedule]] for an example of what the weekend will be like.

On the Saturday evening, the group will likely dine together and enjoy refreshments at one of Cambridge's numerous fine establishments.

If you would like to submit a proposal for any of the above, contact juliusbaxter@gmail.com or post to the [[OR1K:Community_Portal#Mailing_lists|OpenRISC mailing lists]].
