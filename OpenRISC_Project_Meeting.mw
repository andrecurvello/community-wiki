=== Audience ===

This meeting will be accessible for anyone with a background in embedded systems at any level, whether acquainted with the project or not.

=== Date & Time ===

The event will run from 2pm on '''Saturday, October 5''' to early afternoon on '''Sunday, October 6'''. (This date has been amended since the first announcement.)

Lunch will be available from 12:30 on Saturday. The sessions will run until the evening, and be followed by dinner in a local pub. Sessions will resume Sunday morning and conclude after lunch in the early afternoon.

This arrangement should allow people to travel on Saturday morning and return home Sunday evening.

=== Venue ===

This year's conference will be held at the [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/ University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory] in '''Cambridge, England'''. A ''big'' thank you to David Greaves and the Computer Labs for hosting us.

The address is:

'''Room FW11''', Cambridge University Computer Laboratory,
15 JJ Thomson Avenue,
CB3 0FD Cambridge,
United Kingdom 

==== Accommodation ====

Some recommendations for places to stay are:

* [http://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/577/Cambridge-Newmarket-Road-hotel Travelodge Newmarket Road] - they are quoting 50GBP for Friday night and 86GBP for Saturday night. It is close enough to town to walk, but is a 45-minute walk to the conference venue. Taxis between the train station and conference venue would be the best bet (if several are staying here they could be shared).
* [http://www.kayak.co.uk/#/hotels/Arundel-House-Hotel,Cambridge,CAM,United-Kingdom-c17146-h80251/2013-10-04/2013-10-06 Arundel House] - this is a well located hotel, and are quoting 77GBP per night when booked on Kayak.co.uk. The conference venue is a 25-minute walk from here.

==== Travel ====

Cambridge is well connected in the UK by train, and internationally via all of London's airports. However, '''London Stansted''' airport is the closest, and is only a 30-minute train ride from the center of Cambridge.

The Cambridge University Computer Laboratory website has a good section on[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/directions/ how to get there].

=== Cost ===

It is expected the conference will be free to attend, thanks to our wonderful [[#Sponsors|sponsors]].

== Talk and workshop abstracts ==

=== A SystemC model of a multicore OpenRISC with power annotation ===

David Greaves, Cambridge University Computer Laboratory

David has developed a SystemC model of a multicore OpenRISC design, which has been used for teaching at the University for some years. This model is unusual in having annotations for power usage, so it can give estimates of power consumption as well as system performance when run.

=== Defining a Domain Specific Language for the Configuration of SoPCs Based on the OpenRISC Platform ===

Martin Schulze

=== OpTiMSoC - an OpenRISC-based Manycore System-on-Chip ===

Stefan Wallentowitz, Technical University of Munich

=== ORPSoC on the DE0-nano ===

Julius Baxter

This is a workshop first given by Julius Baxter at[chiphack.org ChipHack], showing how to bring up ORPSoC on the DE0-nano. Partipants are encouraged to install the free Altera Quartus FPGA tools before arriving at the conference. A number of DE0-nano's will be available, but feel free to bring your own.

=== mor1kx progress report and demo ===

Stefan Kristiansson and Julius Baxter

=== Hands off the cores! Hands-on with ORPSoCv3 ===

Olof Kindgren and others

A walkthrough to get started with using ORPSoCv3. Might be organized as a workshop if there is interest for it.

=== OpenRISC 2000 ===

Jeremy Bennett

This has been bouncing around for a couple of years, and it would be good to start to get some more concrete direction. Implementing OpenRISC (in silicon and in simulation) is a popular undergraduate project, and defining OR2K now might give a chance for someone to implement it during the coming academic year.

=== Update and discussion on the OpenRISC toolchain ===

Stefan Kristiansson

This year has been a lot quieter on the toolchain side than last year, but there are a couple of things of interest that could be discussed. At least one thing I have in mind is our ABI. There have been a couple of occurrences of projects that abuse the C standard for varargs, hurting us "small, different guys".

There are a couple of other things in our ABI that aren't all perfect, so maybe some venting of those issues and whether we need an "ABI v2.0" would be something we should consider.

=== Bug squashing session ===

We did this last year as the final session after lunch on Sunday. People joined in for as long as they could until their flights/trains left. It's a good chance to clear up Bugzilla once each year.
