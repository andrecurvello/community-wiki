= Fall/Autmun 2012, Stockholm =

A meeting is proposed for developers and users of the OpenRISC Project in late 2012.

== Audience ==

It is intended that the meeting would be useful for both developers and users of the platform to attend.

== Date & Time ==

The date for the event is '''Saturday, October 13''' with sessions starting at 12:30. Further sessions may be scheduled for Sunday morning. See the schedule for further details when it's available.

== Venue ==

Realtime Embedded, Sveavagen 64, Stockholm, Sweden

Further details can be found here: [http://www.rte.se/sv/kontakt http://www.rte.se/sv/kontakt]

== Schedule ==

It is planned that the event will be run over Saturday and Sunday, with the bulk of the presentations on the Saturday.

A later start on Saturday is likely, as this allows for people who will travel to the event to do this on the Saturday morning which is usually easier and cheaper.

=== Saturday ===

It is proposed that the day start after lunch, and run until the evening with presentations as short as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk lightning talks] to full hour-long presentations/demonstrations with questions.

Once the sessions are complete participants will be encouraged to continue on to a restaurant for dinner together.

A running order for the day will be decided closer to the event.

=== Sunday ===

If there is enough interest, more could be run on Sunday morning, such as another meet-up for technical work on parts of the project by interested parties, or further discussions or presentations.
