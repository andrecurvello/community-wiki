Please let us know any timing constraints on your attendance when registering. (<tt>set_multicycle_path -start 1hr -from {i:you} -to {i:orconf}</tt>)

=== Audience ===

This meeting will be accessible for anyone with a background in embedded systems at any level, whether acquainted with the project or not.

=== Date & Time ===

The event will run over '''Saturday, October 5''' and '''Sunday, October 6'''. (This date has been amended since the first announcement.)

It is expected the event will run from early afternoon on Saturday, into the evening and sessions will resume Sunday morning and finish around early afternoon.

This arrangement should allow people to travel on Saturday morning and return home Sunday evening.

=== Venue ===

This year's conference will be held at the [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/ University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory] in '''Cambridge, England'''. A ''big'' thank you to David Greaves and the Computer Labs for hosting us.

Cambridge is well connected in the UK by train, and internationally via all of London's airports. However, '''London Stansted''' airport is the closest, and is only a 30-minute train ride from the center of Cambridge.

=== Cost ===

It is expected the conference will be free to attend, thanks to our wonderful [[#Sponsors|sponsors]].

=== Schedule ===

There is no firm schedule as yet. It will consist of presentations, discussions and (possibly) workshops. See [[OpenRISC_Project_Meetings_Archive#Schedule|last year's schedule]] for an example of what the weekend will be like.

The planned presentations, thus far, are as follows:

* [http://optimsoc.org OpTiMSoC] - an OpenRISC-based Manycore System-on-Chip, Stefan Wallentowitz
* [https://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx mor1kx] progress report and demo, Stefan Kristiansson and Julius Baxter
* Defining a Domain Specific Language for the Configuration of SoPCs Based on the OpenRISC Platform, Martin Schulze

On the Saturday evening, the group will likely dine together and enjoy refreshments at one (or a few) of Cambridge's numerous fine establishments.

If you would like to submit a proposal for any of the above, contact juliusbaxter@gmail.com or post to the [[OR1K:Community_Portal#Mailing_lists|OpenRISC mailing lists]].
