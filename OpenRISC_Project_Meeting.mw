=== Presentation Proposals ===

We are now accepting presentation proposals.

We'd really enjoy presentations from anyone who is involved in the open source hardware design sphere. The OpenRISC project's concerns are many and varied, from computer architecture and RTL implementations, to open source EDA tools and flows, to tool chains, debuggers and software from bare metal to Linux user space.

Presentation formats are flexible, let us know what you'd prefer and we'll be sure to accommodate you.

Please send proposals to either:
# [mailto:openrisc@lists.openrisc.net;openrisc@lists.opencores.org?Subject=ORCONF2014%20Presentation%20Proposal OpenRISC mailinglist(s)]
# [mailto:juliusbaxter@gmail.com;olof.kindgren@gmail.com?Subject=ORCONF2014%20Presentation%20Proposal the event organisers directly]. 

If you're unsure about anything feel free to drop us a line via email or on our [[OR1K:Community_Portal#IRC|IRC channel, #openrisc on irc.freenode.net]].
