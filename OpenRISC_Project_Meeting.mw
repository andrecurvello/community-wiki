= Fall/Autmun 2012, Stockholm =

A meeting is proposed for developers and users of the OpenRISC Project in late 2012.

== Date ==

At present, the proposed date for the event is '''Saturday, October 13'''.

== Venue ==

No specific venue has been confirmed yet, other than that it will occur somewhere in Stockholm, Sweden.

== Schedule ==

It is planned that the event will be run over Saturday and Sunday, with the bulk of the presentations on the Saturday.

A later start on Saturday is likely, as this allows for people who will travel to the event to do this on the Saturday which is usually easier and cheaper.

=== Saturday ===

It is proposed that the day start after lunch, and run until the evening with presentations as short as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk lightning talks] to full hour-long presentations/demonstrations with questions.

A running order for the day will be decided closer to the event.

=== Sunday ===

If there is enough interest, more could be run on Sunday morning, such as another meet-up for technical work on parts of the project by interested parties, or further discussions or presentations.

Please contact juliusbaxter at gmail.com or post to the OpenRISC mailing lists for further information or presentation proposals.
