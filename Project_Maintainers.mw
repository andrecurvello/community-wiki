The '''project maintainer''' is the guardian of quality for a particular component of the OpenRISC project. In particular, nothing should be committed to a repository until it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant maintainer.

=== Proposed maintainer roles ===

As the OpenRISC project grows and matures there is a need for maintainers to appointed to to manage various components of the project.

At present there are some well-defined maintainer roles being fulfilled by contributors for the upkeep of, for example, [[or1ksim]]([[User:Jeremybennett|Jeremy Bennett]]) and the [[Linux|Linux kernel port]] ([[User:Jonibo|Jonas Bonn]]).

There is a need to define roles for maintainership of other parts of the project and assign them to people.

Roles that could be defined and assigned immediately are:
* OR1200 specification and RTL maintainer
* OR1K architecture specification (document?) maintainer
* Nightly build maintainer
* add another role here!

== Responsibilities of a maintainer ==

 I've only just added this - not sure how much of this is appropriate or necessary! [[User:Julius|Julius]]

Some responsibilities of a maintainer would be:
* Active in, and responsive to, the community's work with their component of the project.
* Outline a preferred method of development and release for that component
** Decide how patches will be submitted, reviewed and applied
** Outline an approximate release/development cycle
* Have the ultimate say in any contentious development issues
* Help the project progress and develop
