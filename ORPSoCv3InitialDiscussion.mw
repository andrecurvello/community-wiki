Why ORPSoCv3? Because [[User:julius|Julius]] would hate the name ;)

ORPSoC is the reference platform for OpenRISC development. It has many users and can be extended to lots of FPGA boards. There are however many users that prefer minSOC as it is considered to be easier to get started with.

Here's a proposal for improving things in ORPSoC land

== Create a separate project ==

ORPSoC pulls together lots of different OpenCores projects. It should be a separate project in its own right, like [[OR1K:MinSoC]], not part of OpenRISC (which should just be about the processor). [[User:Jeremybennett|Jeremybennett]] 19:13, 18 August 2011 (CEST)

== Modules ==
* Use the <code>modules</code> directory for external cores. These could be managed with svn externals, git submodules, or symlinks if it's not desirable to just dump the cores there. [[User:Olof|Olof]] 19:19, 18 August 2011 (CEST)
* Add a top level Makefile that contains the following rules [[User:Olof|Olof]] 19:19, 18 August 2011 (CEST)
** list-rtl-files : Returns a list of the modules' and it's submodules' rtl-files. Used in top level Makefile to create project files for synthesis and simulation
** list-include-dirs : Returns a list of the modules' and it's submodules' directories containing include files. Used in top level Makefile to create project files for synthesis and simulation

== Configuration ==
Kbuild has been proposed here. Pros/cons?

I would like to have a standardized set of makefiles for every ORPSoC build, and include a Makefile.inc that contains all user parameters. I've been discussing with Saar Drimer at [https://www.boldport.com/docs/fpgaproj boldport] about integrating his work with our efforts [[User:Olof|Olof]] 09:48, 19 August 2011 (CEST)

For hardware configuration we should aim to replace defines and defparams with parameters [[User:Olof|Olof]] 21:00, 19 August 2011 (CEST)
== Software integration ==
People might want to build software running on their ORPSoC. Is this feasible?

== Name and version ==
Actually, ORPSoCv3 makes sense, but I'd prefer to see it called just ORPSoC and have version numbers (my flavor of the month) for the project when we tag it beginning at 3.0.0. We could then refer to the previous versions as 1 (the original, long gone) and 2 (the one being worked on at the moment, expect to see this in use until 3.0 gets up.)
