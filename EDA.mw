= Simulators / Compilers =

== Icarus Verilog ==

This is an open source event-driven Verilog simulator. It's home page is [http://iverilog.icarus.com/ http://iverilog.icarus.com/]

=== Installation under Ubuntu ===

Using apt-get:

 sudo apt-get install verilog

== Silos ==

This is a relatively low-cost Verilog simulator. Its web page is [http://www.silvaco.com/products/verilogSimulation/silos.html http://www.silvaco.com/products/verilogSimulation/silos.html]

== Verilator ==

This is an open source tool that can be used to generate cycle-accurate C models from synthesizeable Verilog. It also has a quite thorough linting feature. Its web page is [http://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator http://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator].

= Waveform Viewers =

= GTKWave =

This tool is a great open source waveform viewer. It's home page is [http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/ http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/].

== Installing under Ubuntu ==

The pre-packaged GTKWave can be installed under Ubuntu using apt-get with the following.

 sudo apt-get install gtkwave

== Building from source under Ubuntu 11.04 32-bit ==

Go grab the latest source bundle. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/files/ http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/files/]

Extract it.

 tar xzf gtkwave-3.3.26.tar.gz

Go in and configure it.

 cd gtkwave-3.3.26/
 ./configure --enable-fatlines  --disable-tcl

At this stage it complained I didn't have gperf installed

 sudo apt-get install gperf

At this stage it said xz couldn't be found for LZMA or VZT format support.
Ubuntu informs me I already have the xz-utils and lzma packages so I don't know what to install so just disable it.

 ./configure --enable-fatlines  --disable-tcl --disable-xz

At this point it complains I don't have gtk+-2.0 installed.

 sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0

Finally configure again.

 ./configure --enable-fatlines  --disable-tcl --disable-xz

Make and install it

 make
 sudo make install
