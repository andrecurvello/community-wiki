A virtual image can be useful for developers that can't or don't want to install all the necessary tools on their machines. An old image exists, but it is getting outdated. Here's a proposal for useful tools on the image

* SVN
* GIT
* GCC with necessary libs for compiling the tool chain
* autoconf >=1.59
* automake >=1.9.2
* libtool >=1.5.6
* Icarus Verilog
* Verilator

Documented tasks should include:
* Building or1ksim
* Building newlib and uClibc
* Running tests in ORPSoC
* Running linux and bare metal programs in or1ksim
* Building for FPGA

Bonus points if someone creates helper scripts for downloading and setting up Xilinx/Actel/Altera tool chains
